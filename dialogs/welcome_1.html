        <h4>This workflow guides you through selecting case and control samples and performing core bioinformatics analyses, such as odds ratio tests and survival analysis. Begin by carefully selecting well-defined and relevant case and control samples for your study. Then, utilize bioinformatics agents to execute the chosen analyses. Finally, LLM agents will generate conclusion reports to summarize the analysis results, providing a clear and accessible format for interpretation and sharing.
